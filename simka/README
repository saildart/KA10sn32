# I have reduced SIMS from github (by Richard Cornwell) to simulate
# only one machine, the KA serial #32 that was at Stanford in 1974,
# which had type=3330-2 disk packs, 200 Megabytes each,
# at files in ~/ckd/SYS00[0-1].ckd
#
# which is on github.com:saildart/waits-disk
#       as Chickadee DISKPACK[0-1].ckd
# The TLA "SYS" is over-used and ambigous;
# I will try to replace it with a short specific term, here "diskpack"
# or a short memorable word "chickadee" to remind us of "ckd" from Cornwell Sky world.

# The PDP-10 simulator binary is named 'simka'
# it has the RMS, Robert M Supnik, simulator control program from the SIMH world
# to run a PDP-10KA simulator written by Richard Cornwell,
# and reduced to emulating only the Stanford serial #32 instance of the PDP-10KA
# with two segment user memory relocation (prior to the BBN mapper installed in 1975)
# and without the PDP-6 co-processor.

# The PDP-6 I/O devices of 1974 are simulated on the PDP-10

# FIRST, Launch independent python display terminal servers
# for the triple-III and/or the Data Disc graphics user interfaces
# which will YAML message with the PDP-10 simulator
# by waiting to accept connections at well-know-port number #1974 and #1976.
