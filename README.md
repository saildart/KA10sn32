# KA10sn32

![foo](AI_PDP_dave_poole.png "banner")

Simulators for the unique PDP-10 KA serial number 32 at Stanford for July 1974.
Two extra opcodes (XCTR and FIXX_ were hacked in by Dave Poole.
July 1974 is just after the IBM-3330 "pizza oven" multi-pack disk system
had been upgraded to double-density with 200 Megabytes per spindle;
but before the BBN address mapping box was installed in 1975.

The simulated hardware configuration is as follows:

generic | specific
-------------------------- | --------------------------------
disks for file system | IBM-3330 with 200MB per drive
disk for swapping | Librascope
vector graphics terminals | Information International Inc
raster graphics terminals | Data Disc
console teletype | Teletype Model 35
teletype terminals | Teletype Model 37
teletype terminals | Teletype Model 33
custom keyboard scanner | designed by Lester Earnest
custom keyboards | from Micro Switch Corp Freeport, Illinois
custom video switch | designed by Lester Earnest
custom color video | made by Lynn Quam
The wizard in the picture | is Dave Poole
chain line printer | Data Products
xerographic printer | Xerox Graphics Printer
custom calendar clock | made by Phil Petit
mobile robot | Stanford Cart
robot arms | by Vic Scheinman

The very early 1960s Stanford hardware is not include;
such as the Rancho Arm, the III image dissector and the Type-30 display.
Significant 1974 hardware NOT included in these simulators
are the co-processors the PDP-6, the IMP interface, the PDP-11/45,
the Mars Image processor known as the SPS-41 and the Imlac terminals.
The unrealible Librascope is resurrected into perfect existence ready for swapping,
but then is not needed by these simulators.

Supporting the simulators there is a common pool of file-systems and data-sets.

Above is one of the original 1970s keyboards for SAIL-WAITS in the D.C.Power Building.
Below is a recent 2010s WASD custom keyboard for SAILDART simulators.

The key board with green key caps is authentic. Earnest is quite certain
that the zero 0-key should be to the left of the one 1-key.
The key board with blue key caps is practical for 21st century people.
Note the five space ship icons which serve as spacewar buttons.
The arrangement of the 26 Stanford
unique characters differs between
the green and blue keyboards.
